## Remark on using the dataset

-You may use this dataset with Char2Char or Word2Word encoding in Transformer or in LSTM as shown in the paper above. 

-You may also generate different variations of the questions using the generator files. 

# Information: 
- This is an open source project, so feeel free to help us grow this dataset!
- For mathematics dataset, the generated datasets are provided. We will include the generator soon.
- For Science dataset, the generator files can be used to generate the required number of samples. 
- For some Mathematics data, see: https://github.com/deepmind/mathematics_dataset 
- Some part of the codes for mathematics datasets were written by Pratik Mandlecha (Microsoft, Hyderabad)
