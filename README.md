## Remark on using the dataset

-You may use this dataset with Char2Char or Word2Word encoding in Transformer or in LSTM as shown in the paper above.

-You may also generate different variations of the questions using the generator files.

# Information: 
- This is an open source project, so feeel free to help us grow this dataset!
- For any dataset, the generator files can be used to generate the required number of samples.
- Some existing range of values for quantities in generator file may not make sense, feel free to adapt those.
- some part of Mathematics dataset is adapted from deepmind dataset, for more Mathematics data see: https://github.com/deepmind/mathematics_dataset
- Some part of the codes for mathematics datasets were written by Pratik Mandlecha (Microsoft, Hyderabad)
