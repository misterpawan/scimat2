# A stone of mass 0.05 kg is thrown vertically upwards. Give the direction and magnitude of the net force on the pebble,
#(a) during its upward motion,
#(b) during its downward motion,
#(c) at the highest point where it is momentarily at rest. 
# Do your answers change if the pebble was thrown at an angle of 45Â° with the horizontal direction

# Give the magnitude and direction of the net force acting on a stone of mass 0.1 kg,
#(a) just after it is dropped from the window of a stationary train,
#(b) just after it is dropped from the window of a train running at a constant velocity of 36 km/ h,
#(c) just after it is dropped from the window of a train accelerating with 1 ms-2,
#(d) lying on the floor of a train which is accelerating with 1 m s~2, the stone being at rest relative to the train.

# A rocket with a lift-off mass 20,000 kg is blasted upwards with an initial acceleration of 5.0 ms-2. Calculate the initial thrust (force) of the blast.
