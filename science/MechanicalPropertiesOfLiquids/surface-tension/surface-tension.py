# A U-shaped wire is dipped in a soap solution, and removed. A thin soap film formed between the wire and a light slider supports a weight of 1.5 x 10-2 N (which includes the small weight of the slider). The length of the slider is 30 cm. What is the surface tension of the film?

# What is the pressure inside a drop of mercury of radius 3.0 mm at room temperature? Surface tension of mercury at that temperature (20Â°C) is 4.65 x 10-1 Nm-1. The atmospheric pressure is 1.01 x 105 Pa. Also give the excess pressure inside the drop.
